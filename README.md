# ChatBot
A chatbot is a software that provides human-like conversations with users via text message on chat. Its main task is to help users by providing answers to their asked questions. We will make the software intelligent by using deep learning. So that the chatbot could predict more accurate responses to the user and also understand the user what he/she is trying to ask and give feedback according to its understanding.
Nowadays, chatbots are used alot in customer interaction, you can see the live example of zomato, amazon, etc which are using these chatbots for customer interactions, and also for marketing on social network sites.

There are two types of chatbot models based on how they are built:
* Retrieval based model: This chatbot uses predefined input patterns and responses.
* Generative based model: This chatbot is not based on some predefined responses.

How to Make a Chatbot in Python Step By Step.
1. Prepare the Dependencies
2. Import Classes
3. Create and Train the Chatbot
4. Communicate with the Python Chatbot
5. Train your Python Chatbot with a Corpus of Data

Needed Libraries
You should have this following libraries in your system which will be required while creating ChatBot :

* Tensorflow (pip install tensorflow)
*  Keras (pip install keras)
* Numpy (pip install numpy)
* Natural Language processing (Nltk) (pip install nltk)
* Pickle (pip install pickle)

Chatbot Project Dataset
* We will be using intents.json file which you will find in source code of this chat bot project
